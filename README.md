# OpenAgent
General purpose AI agent 'framework' for Adaptive AI Agents

## Abstract  
This document outlines the vision, architecture, and implementation strategy for OpenAgent, an open-source AI agent framework designed to deliver scalable, adaptable, and efficient solutions for task and knowledge management in real-world applications.

---

## Introduction  
The landscape of AI tools has rapidly evolved, but a significant gap remains in frameworks that adapt to the context of users and their environments while operating efficiently across resource-constrained settings. OpenAgent addresses this gap by offering a lightweight, multi-platform framework that supports advanced capabilities like web search, LLM integration, and dynamic task management.

---

## Goals  
- **Scalability**: Ensure seamless scaling from personal projects to enterprise-level systems.  
- **Efficiency**: Optimize compute resource usage to reduce costs, leveraging modern hardware like Apple Silicon AI cores.  
- **Adaptability**: Enable agents to adapt to user context and improve performance based on feedback loops.  
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Provide a foundation for community-driven enhancements.

---

## Features  
1. **Capabilities**:  
   - Web Search: Integrate APIs for real-time information retrieval.  
   - LLM Connections: Utilize local and external models for natural language understanding.  

2. **Knowledge**:  
   - Access structured and unstructured data from company databases, cloud storage, and local files.  

3. **Task Management**:  
   - Facilitate task prioritization with a focus on user-defined workflows like 'NOW/NEXT.'  

4. **Compute Optimization**:  
   - Dynamically allocate compute resources based on task complexity and time constraints.  

5. **Deployment**:  
   - Support for containerized environments with Docker and multi-cloud compatibility.

---

## Architecture Overview  
- **Core Modules**: Handle agent capabilities and task orchestration.  
- **Knowledge Repository**: Centralized access to all knowledge features.  
- **Feedback Loop**: **Feedback Loop**: Optimize performance using TensorZero's feedback loop mechanisms. ([tensorzero.com](https://www.tensorzero.com/docs)).

## Implementation  
### Initial Setup  
1. **Environment Preparation**:  
   Install prerequisites, including Python, TypeScript, and Docker.  

2. **Repository Initialization**:  
   Set up the GitHub repository with the following structure:  
   ```
   OpenAgent/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── core/
   │   ├── modules/
   │   └── tests/
   ├── Dockerfile
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── README.md
   └── LICENSE
   ```

3. **Dependencies**:  
   - Flask for API routing.  
   - FastAPI for high-performance endpoints (optional).  
   - TypeScript for front-end components (if needed).  

---

## Roadmap  
1. Phase One: Core framework and documentation.  
2. Phase Two: Add dynamic task prioritization and compute-based accuracy adjustments.  
3. **Phase Three: Adaptive Autonomy**  
   Move beyond integration-focused functionality to develop **adaptive autonomy** for the AI agent. In this phase, OpenAgent will:  
   - **Self-Learning Mechanisms**: Implement systems that allow the agent to continuously learn from user behavior and external feedback loops, refining task prioritization and improving efficiency over time.  
   - **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Introduce protocols for agents to collaborate and share insights across distributed environments.  
   - **Enhanced Personalization**: Build sophisticated user modeling techniques, enabling the agent to anticipate user needs and provide proactive assistance.

## Conclusion  
OpenAgent seeks to redefine how AI agents operate by combining adaptability, scalability, and efficiency. This document serves as the foundation for building a community-driven platform to advance AI capabilities for all.
